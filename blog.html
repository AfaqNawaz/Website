            Glassdoor is a helpful tool for many job seekers looking for company information and honest employee reviews. However, they also have a blog filled with up-to-date information and job market trends. Check it out here.
            
            <h2>YouTube Channels</h2>
            If you prefer to consume video content over written posts, there are a lot of great channel options for marketing, creative and digital job seekers. Here are a few we suggest:
            
            Self Made Millennial
            Self Made Millennial has been featured on Business Insider, Newsweek,  and Forbes, and named a “Top 10 YouTube Channel for Job Seekers,” and a “Top 5 Career YouTube Channel.” Madeline Mann has experience from her career in HR and recruiting and shares her real-world advice on many job hunting topics.

            <h2>Podcasts</h2>
            If you are anything like the marketing crew at Celarity, you prefer a podcast over anything else. Here are our current choices to get the best job seeker advice:
            
            Career Warrior Podcast
            This podcast provides motivational advice and job hunting strategies from industry professionals, resume experts, and other job seekers. Episode lengths range from 9 minutes to 35 minutes, so you won’t have to spend an entire hour to get some actionable advice out of a single episode.
            
            Find Your Dream Job
            Find Your Dream Job offers job seekers insider secrets, job search tips, and advice on how to develop a purposeful career. Episodes generally last around 25 minutes and feature professional guests.

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            Tools are an essential part of the marketing, creative and digital job seeker’s journey to finding new opportunities that match their specific skills set. Here are some of our top tool suggestions to use in 2022:
            
            Salary.com
            This tool is employer-reported data which is more meaningful than employee reported data on platforms like Indeed and Glassdoor. Additionally, you can run reports and input custom information to adjust for specific pay factors. It’s not perfect but the information will give you a baseline.
            
            Google Alerts
            Google Alerts allows users to set up notifications for specific topics or terms. Whenever that term is mentioned on the web, the alert will send a notification to your email address. You can use the alert to follow a company you’re interested in or be notified about a new job posting within a specific company. Here’s how to set-up Google Alerts.
            
            <h2>LinkedIn</h2>
            As of 2021, LinkedIn has 760 million users — 40% of them are accessing it on a daily basis. LinkedIn has become one of the prime ways that professionals connect in a world where virtual influence now rules. From creating your own personal brand to finding the next best career opportunity for you, LinkedIn has become the way in which marketing, creative and digital professionals engage.
